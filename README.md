# Grocery List Generator
 First own app, created after a long break from dev stuff.

## Just a few commits?
I haven't done any commits yet (just simply forgot about it, sorry!), but there's gonna be plenty of space for that, because I want to improve that code as much as I can right now.

## Upcoming features
- Cleaner JS code.
- Simpler JS code.
- Mobile-ready.
- Local storage features and adjusting hash purposes.
- Copy link to the clipboard with one click.
